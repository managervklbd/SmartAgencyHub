Hi, I need your help urgently with the Smart Lead Finder issues.
The current behaviour is causing wrong results, duplicates and the “Select All” function is still not working properly. Here is the exact problem list:

1. “Select All” is still not working

When I search for leads, for example:

software company in Chittagong

Total results show: 184

But “Select All” selects only 63 or 70 or 80, not all 184

I have to repeatedly load pages and re-select, which is not professional and not usable.

✔ I need “Select All” to select ALL results at once — no matter 50, 100, 500, or 5,000.
✔ Even if I click pagination, it must still remain selected.

2. Duplicate leads are still being added

Even if the lead already exists (same email / same website), Smart Lead Finder still adds the same business again.

✔ I need strict duplicate protection:

Match by email

OR match by website

OR match by business name
If any match exists → Skip automatically, do not add duplicate.

3. Category saving is not working correctly

After import, all leads are saved under Smart Lead Finder category instead of the category I selected.

✔ Requirement:
When importing, the selected category must be saved in the lead entry.
Example:
If I select “Software company” → all imported leads must show “Software company” in the Leads page.

4. Data inconsistency: Result count vs actual data

Example:

Found 184 results

But only 60–70 results actually load

And Select All only selects those partial results

This means pagination is not fully loaded and the internal state is inconsistent.

✔ Need a fix so the system loads 100% of results before import selection.
OR
✔ Provide a backend solution to fetch ALL results at once.

5. Want your recommended improvements applied

Whatever you suggested before regarding:

Accurate pagination

Full dataset loading

Eliminating partial pages

Proper filtering

Accurate Google Local + Maps handling

Please apply the final stable and professional solution, not intermediate experiments.

⚠️ Summary of what I need done

Select All must select ALL results, no matter how many pages.

Strict duplicate protection (email / website / business name).

Correct category saving during import.

Accurate result count & full loading of all results.

Stable, professional implementation—not experimental.

Please fix these issues completely.
Thanks!
