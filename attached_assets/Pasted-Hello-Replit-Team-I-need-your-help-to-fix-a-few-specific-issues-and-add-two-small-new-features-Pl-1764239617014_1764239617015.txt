Hello Replit Team,

I need your help to fix a few specific issues and add two small new features. Please do not touch any other part of the system. Only fix the issues listed below.

1️⃣ Chat System Issue (Highest Priority)

The chat system is still not working correctly for multi-project clients.

Current problem:

When a developer has 2 assigned projects (Client A & Client B)

Messages from Client A show correctly

But messages from Client B do NOT show in Client B’s chat inbox

Developer can see messages from both clients

Admin can see everything

But the client cannot see the developer’s reply unless the project belongs to that exact client_id

Expected behavior (what I need):

Each client should only see messages from their own projects

Each developer should see messages for all projects assigned to them

Admin should see all conversations

Messages between developer ↔ client must be visible to both sides for each project

Important:
Please update the chat logic so that:

✔ The system fetches messages based on project_id and client_id relationship
✔ Each client gets a unified inbox for their own projects only
✔ Developers see all assigned project messages
✔ Admin sees everything

⚠️ Do not modify any other module except the messaging system.

2️⃣ Smart Lead Finder – Complete Selection & No Duplicates

The Smart Lead Finder is improved, but still two problems remain:

a. “Select All” does not select ALL results after search
Example:
Search → shows 184 results
Select All → selects only 63

Expected:
Select All must select 100% of search results.

b. Duplicate leads still appear
Need full duplicate protection using:

Email

Website

Business name (normalization)

3️⃣ Add Category While Importing Leads

When importing leads, I want to assign a custom category and save it properly so that:

✔ In the Leads page, filtering by category works
✔ No duplicate lead gets saved with a different category

4️⃣ Add Two Video Links Section in Client Project Panel

I want to show 2 YouTube video links per project:

One Presentable Short Video

One Full Software Feature Video

Please add:

Two input fields in each project

Fields must appear in the client portal project page

Admin, operational_head, developer can edit

Client can only view

5️⃣ Add “Project Credentials” Section

Inside each project page, add a small section:

Project Credentials

Hosting link (Render / Namecheap / etc.)

Admin login link

Username

Password

Notes

Only admin & developer can edit.
Client can only view.

6️⃣ Must Keep System Untouched

⚠️ Very Important:

Please do NOT modify or change anything outside these requested features.
Only fix these issues. Do not restructure or refactor the system.

Thank you! Please proceed with ONLY these changes.
